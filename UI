Bugs and issues

End of images in imageview screen (DONE)
Memory creation progress bar and refine uploading moments progress bar (DONE)

Add memory , memory should be added to the top (DONE : temporary fix for mobile devices)

In sagas improve create memory flow by call addMoments action/function after uploading memory meta-data (or not , take a look)

Set Title in memoriesGrid should be set when memories are fetched else it is causing a reflow of the entire screen just to set the string 'memories' in header
	(Actually now that we're using separate headers we can get rid of the whole set title thingy , it was a mess anyway)
On create memory return need to set coverMoment on memoriesGrid screen
Change add moments preview screen to better reflect general practice and native app
After adding new Moments the moments are not displayed properly on return (that is filling their container based on landscape or portrait logic)
Moments GridView is not smooth in mobile (consider using react-grid to see if it improves performance)
Join cherry in weblink page
Copy option in weblink dialog
disable scrolling in background for imageview screen (can contribute to the library https://github.com/fritz-c/react-image-lightbox/issues/6)
Headroom is not working smoothly on mobile devices
Going back from moments to memories page (To fetch or not to fetch memories again , that is the question )
Appropriate message on accessing unavailable or unauthorized memories
Handle authToken mismatch (Actually you need to have a check for authToken validity everytime)
In grid image display landscape and portrait break if the image is perfectly square





Comprehensive list of cherry features to be built or deployed in production

1. HTTPS everywhere
2. progressive web app
3. Instagram style moments  grid views update (MAJOR FEATURE)
4. Smooth fade-in of images (instagram-like)
5. Snackbar should just work (In a perfect world the undo button in the snackbar should undo the last dispatched action ,
	no idea how this could work for network actions maybe like becomes unlike and create becomes delete and so on)
6. Shit needs to be Gzipped in prod
