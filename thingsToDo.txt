SUPER-CRITICAL :
	[-] handle memory display when there is no coverUrl
	- handle moments display when there is no coverUrl
	- shit needs to be responsive
	[-] figure out importing images (IN pROD ??)
	- figure out moments slideshow
	[-] pass country code during register
	- handle input edit login
	- google analytics

CRITICAL :
	[-] separate out singleMomentreducer (to better handle moment level actions) (DONE)

PROGRESS :
    -prev = hooking up verificationId (done , need to set and get user when token is present (refresh user details))
    -current = setup memories view (https://github.com/eiriklv/react-masonry-component) [MASONRY_COMPONENT] (doing) look for alternatives
	-next = (MemoriesView(handles fetching memories) , MemoryView(handles clicking on options , memory , redirection to momentsView) , MomentsView (handles fetching and displaying moments), MomentView(handle like etc))
		-separate authenticated component from MemoriesView (done partially , its the default /memories route need to change this)
		-populate momentsView (need to define state shape) (done partially state shape not finalized , need to normalize)
		-setup initial profile (name and image) consider normalizing response

	-then = clean up all pending thingsToDo (FRIDAY)

thingsToDo  :
	- use npm-shrinkwrap (to lock dependencies , avoid dependency hell)
	- setup testing environment (done unit-tests mocha , karma , , e2e testing nightwatch (pending) http://nightwatchjs.org/)
		- dynamically generating tests for reducers and actions  (https://mochajs.org/#dynamically-generating-tests)
		- consider replacing expect with chai (assertion library choice)
	- login redirect should include the original(authenticated) url that the user was trying to access and redirect accordingly (pending)
	- separate configs for dev and prod (pending)
	- handle all error messages using material TextField and snackbar centrally ?? (implementation decision)
	- use spread operators and es6 syntax wherever possible
	[-] country code number validation (DONE)
	- Testing up to date (50% coverage FRIDAY)
